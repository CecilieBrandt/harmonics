Harmonics
=============
This plug-in is an implementation of a novel free-form shell modelling technique based on harmonics. The method extends classical Fourier theory to three-dimensional mesh surfaces and is specifically adapted to an architectural design context. This enables beneficial shape analysis whilst sculpting free-form surfaces using only a few control parameters. The resulting shape, inherently rich in curvature, is an effective means of stiffening a shell against failure by buckling.
